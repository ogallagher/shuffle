    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div id="text">
        Shuffle is an original online strategy board game.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        It requires skill, foresight, patience, and focus.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Size: 2 to 4 players.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <div id="text">
        Each player is given 6 pieces at random locations on the board.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Every piece can move one space at a time, in directions that vary based on piece type.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The six types are as follows, with the piece's movement paired with its name:
    </div>
    
    <div id="subtitle">
        CIRCLE: anywhere
        <div id="piece"><img src="circle.png" alt="o" /></div>
        SQUARE: cardinal
        <div id="piece"><img src="square.png" alt="#" /></div>
        TRIANGLE: diagonal
        <div id="piece"><img src="triangle.png" alt="âˆ†" /></div>
        STAR: anywhere
        <div id="piece"><img src="*.png" alt="*" /></div>
        PLUS: cardinal
        <div id="piece"><img src="+.png" alt="+" /></div>
        EX: diagonal
        <div id="piece"><img src="x.png" alt="x" /></div>
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        On a turn, EVERY player moves ALL the pieces on its team.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Since all pieces move at the same time, there are collisions, and what happens therefore is determined by the involved pieces' types.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The upper three pieces are block pieces, and the lower three are attack pieces. The pieces are listed above in order from fastest to slowest (weakest to strongest).
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The following describe collision scenarios:
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        BLOCK: block[A]-attack[B] = B is sent back
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        SHOVE: block[A]-block[B] = if A is slower, B is shoved. Otherwise, A is shoved
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        TAKE: attack[A]-attack[B] = if A is slower, B is removed. Otherwise, A is removed
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        STICK: same[A]-same[B] = if A and B are the same type, both are sent back
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        SQUASH: any[A]-any[B] = if in one of the collisions above, A is sent to a space occupied by another piece B, A is removed.
    </div>
    
    <h2>End</h2>
    <div id="text">
        Players are eliminated when they have less than 4 pieces remaining.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The game is over when all but one player is eliminated.
    </div>
