    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div id="text">
        Shuffle is an original online strategy board game.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        It requires skill, foresight, patience, and focus.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Size: 2 to 4 players.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <div id="text">
        Each player is given 6 pieces at random locations on the board.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Every piece can move one space at a time, in directions that vary based on piece type.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The six types are as follows, with the piece's movement paired with its name:
    </div>
    
    <div id="subtitle">
        <i>CIRCLE:</i> anywhere
        <div id="piece"><img src="circle.png" alt="o" /></div>
        <i>SQUARE:</i> cardinal
        <div id="piece"><img src="square.png" alt="#" /></div>
        <i>TRIANGLE:</i> diagonal
        <div id="piece"><img src="triangle.png" alt="∆" /></div>
        <i>STAR:</i> anywhere
        <div id="piece"><img src="*.png" alt="*" /></div>
        <i>PLUS:</i> cardinal
        <div id="piece"><img src="+.png" alt="+" /></div>
        <i>EX:</i> diagonal
        <div id="piece"><img src="x.png" alt="x" /></div>
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        On a turn, EVERY player moves ALL the pieces on its team.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Since all pieces move at the same time, there are collisions, and what happens therefore is determined by the involved pieces' types.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The upper three pieces are block pieces, and the lower three are attack pieces. The pieces are listed above in order from fastest to slowest (weakest to strongest).
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The following describe collision scenarios:
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        <i>BLOCK:</i> block[A]-attack[B] = B is sent back.
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        <i>SHOVE:</i>  block[A]-block[B] = if A is slower, B is shoved. Otherwise, A is shoved.
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        <i>TAKE:</i>  attack[A]-attack[B] = if A is slower, B is removed. Otherwise, A is removed.
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        <i>STICK:</i>  same[A]-same[B] = if A and B are the same type, both are sent back.
    </div>
    <div id="list">
        <i>SQUASH:</i>  any[A]-any[B] = if in one of the collisions above, A is sent to a space occupied by another piece B, A is removed.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Looking at the collision scenarios, the <i>STAR</i>  piece is definitely the worst piece on the board. However, if you take a piece (through a <i>SQUASH</i>) with the <i>STAR</i>, it can become a:
    </div>
    <div id="subtitle">
        <i>CAPTAIN</i>: anywhere
        <div id="piece"><img src="captain.png" alt="©" /></div>
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The <i>CAPTAIN</i> is the seventh piece type, which is the slowest (strongest) attack piece on the board.
    </div>
    
    <h2>End</h2>
    <div id="text">
        Players are eliminated when they have less than 4 pieces remaining.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The game is over when all but one player is eliminated.
    </div>

    <h2>Start</h2>
    <div id="text">
        Click on the game at the bottom of this page to initiate it.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        You will be prompted to give a name for yourself. Click on ENTER NAME and do so; then press the play button.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Next, either choose an existing game (diamond buttons on the right) or a preferred game size (the numbers at the bottom).
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        When the game starts, the board is shown. Your pieces are BLUE.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Pick where you want them to move by clicking them. When you've finished, press the play button at the upper right corner.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        When all players are done, the turn will be realized, and you will be able to move your pieces again when all players have seen the turn.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        If you need to quit at any time, press the stop button in the lower right corner.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div id="text">
        To see information on who is playing in your game, and to reveal the stop button, move the mouse/tap outside of the board.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Sometimes the game is prone to sluggishness, so be patient with it...
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Try to avoid sending your <i>EX</i> or your <i>TRIANGLE</i> to the corners; once there it's easy for another player to predict how you'll move.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Piece movement: "anywhere" means "to any adjacent space"; "cardinal" means "up, down, right, and left"; "diagonal" means "up-right, down-right, down-left, and up-left".
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Be wary of possible <i>SQUASH</i>es. You can be <i>SQUASH</i>ed by any piece, and if a <i>STAR</i> <i>SQUASH</i>es another piece, the <i>STAR</i> is converted into a <i>CAPTAIN</i>.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Pieces that are shoved off the board are eliminated.
